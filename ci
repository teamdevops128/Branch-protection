Define triggers for the pipeline, such as code commits, pull requests, or scheduled builds.
Configure the CI tool to run the build process automatically whenever new code changes are pushed to the repository.
Include unit tests, integration tests, API tests, and UI tests as part of the automated testing suite.
Integrate automated testing frameworks (e.g., JUnit, NUnit, Selenium) into the CI pipeline to validate code changes.
  Integrate code analysis and quality assurance tools (e.g., SonarQube, CodeClimate, ESLint) into the CI pipeline.
Perform static code analysis, code style checks, security scans, and dependency vulnerability checks to ensure code quality and compliance with coding standards.
Configure monitoring and reporting within the CI tool to track pipeline execution, test results, build status, and performance metrics.
Set up notifications (e.g., email alerts, Slack notifications) to notify team members about build failures, test failures, or other issues requiring attention.
